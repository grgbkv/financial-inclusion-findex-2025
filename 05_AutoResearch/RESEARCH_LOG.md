Pre-registrations and verdicts, chronological. Rules in program_findex.md.

## E1 — pre-registered
**H:** The 2021→2024 formal-saving surge in developing economies is concentrated where
mobile-money adoption grew: Δsaved_formally correlates with Δmobile_money across the 77
developing panel countries (population-weighted).
**Test:** weighted corr of country-level Δ(fin17a_17a1_d) vs Δ(mobileaccount_t_d), 2021→2024,
pan_dev. Gates: G3 (headline variants), G4 (coverage), G6 (jackknife drop-top-5).
**Keep if:** |r| ≥ 0.30 and G6 sign-stable.
**E2 verdict: DISCARD.** r=0.189 < 0.30 and jackknife sign-unstable (0.19 → −0.005).
Negative result worth keeping in prose: even where mobile money surged, resilience did not
reliably follow within three years — consistent with the paper's access-vs-depth gap.

## P1 — pre-registered (prediction stream)
**Idea:** damped-trend predictor: 2024 = 2021 + λ·(2021−2017), λ=0.5, clipped to [0,100].
**Keep if:** MAE improves on persistence for a target without worsening others materially.
**P1 verdict: DISCARD** (pre-registered rule: no material worsening). Saving −1.32pp MAE,
but account +0.55pp — deceleration makes global trend extrapolation overshoot.

## P2 — pre-registered
**Idea:** per-target policy: persistence for account & resilience; damped trend (λ=0.5)
only for saved_formally. **Keep if:** saving MAE < 9.767 with account/resilience unchanged.
**P2 verdict: KEEP.** Saving 8.448 (was 9.767), others unchanged. Champion updated.

## E3 — pre-registered
**H:** Gender gaps in account ownership closed faster where mobile money grew:
Δ(gap) 2021→2024 correlates negatively with Δmobile_money (dev panel countries, group2 rows).
**Test:** per-country gap = men − women (account_t_d, group2), Δgap vs Δmm, weighted; G4/G6.
**Keep if:** |r| ≥ 0.30, sign negative, G6 stable.
**E3 verdict: DISCARD.** Clean null (r=0.008), verified computation. Gap changes are
heterogeneous (std 7.4pp) but orthogonal to mobile-money growth in the 2021→2024 window.

## E5 — pre-registered
**H:** Digital-payment usage is a leading indicator of account-ownership growth: countries
with high g20_any relative to their account level in 2021 ("usage headroom") grow accounts
faster 2021→2024. **Test:** weighted corr of (g20_2021 − account_2021 percentile-residual…
simplified: corr of g20_2021/account_2021 ratio vs Δaccount) on dev panel; G4/G6.
**Keep if:** |r| ≥ 0.30 and G6 stable.
**E5 verdict: DISCARD (direction rejected).** r=−0.59, robust — the reverse of the
hypothesis. Low-usage countries grew accounts fastest. Suspected confound: plain
convergence on the account level.

## E5b — pre-registered
**H:** The negative usage-ratio effect survives controlling for the 2021 account level —
i.e., among countries at similar account levels, LOWER usage intensity still predicts
faster account growth (accounts-first expansion pattern).
**Test:** weighted partial corr of usage_ratio vs Δaccount controlling account_2021
(residualize both on account_2021, weighted); compare |r_partial| to plain convergence
r(account_2021, Δaccount). Gates G4/G6 on the partials.
**Keep if:** |r_partial| ≥ 0.30 with stable sign.
**E5b verdict: KEEP** (threshold met; sign survives control and jackknife). Caveat logged:
magnitude concentrates in large economies. Reading: mass account-opening drives run ahead
of usage infrastructure — the access-vs-depth gap has a growth signature.

## E7 — pre-registered
**H:** Where formal saving surged 2021→2024, savings became a materially bigger *source of
emergency funds*: Δ(fin24sav share among the resilient) correlates with Δ(saved_formally).
**Test:** fin24sav (would use savings for emergency funds) as pp of adults; weighted corr of
Δfin24sav vs Δsaved_formally, dev panel; G4/G6. **Keep if:** |r| ≥ 0.30, stable.
**E7 verdict: KEEP.** r=0.541; composition of resilience is shifting toward own savings
where the saving surge landed. Same big-economy concentration caveat as E5b.

## E4 — pre-registered
**H:** Dormancy follows account drives with a lag: countries with larger account growth in
2014→2017 had higher inactivity in 2017 (the J-curve the notebook's aggregate chart hints at).
**Test:** weighted corr of Δaccount(2014→2017) vs inactive_t_d(2017)/account(2017) ratio,
dev panel; G4/G6. **Keep if:** r ≥ 0.30 stable.

## E6 — pre-registered
**H:** The unusually narrow 2021 income gap partially reverted by 2024: countries whose
poorest-40 account share jumped most 2017→2021 saw the largest gap re-widening 2021→2024.
**Test:** weighted corr of Δpoor40(2017→2021) vs Δgap(2021→2024), dev panel group2; G4/G6.
**Keep if:** r ≥ 0.30 stable.
**E4 verdict: DISCARD** (general claim). r=0.825 → 0.014 without top-5: a large-country
(India-drive) phenomenon, not a cross-country law. Harness-v2 note: G6 should require
magnitude retention, not just sign stability.
**E6 verdict: DISCARD.** Clean null (r=0.03).

## P3 — pre-registered (prediction stream)
**Idea:** saving predictor using only ≤2021 features: 2024_saving = 2021_saving +
β·mobile_money_2021 + γ·Δmm(2017→2021), β,γ fit by weighted OLS on the 2017→2021
transition (train-period supervision only, no 2024 leakage in fitting).
**Keep if:** saving MAE < 8.448 without touching other targets.
**P3 verdict: DISCARD, reverted to P2.** The saving surge was not forecastable from
pre-2021 mobile-money features fit on the previous transition — contemporaneous
correlation (E1) is not predictability. The surge reads as a regime change.
